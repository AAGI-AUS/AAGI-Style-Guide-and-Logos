# AAGI Style Guide

This repository contains the style guide for Analytics for the Australian Grains Industry (AAGI) project.
It is a living document that will be updated as needed.

The new AAGI logo will be used in conjunction with the three strategic partners and GRDC.
The wheat ear represents the Australian Grains Industry, while the two connector points represent data loading or data sensing points, often used when representing techy, data analytical organisations.
The colours were chosen to look modern and techy.

The style guide is a collection of best practices and guidelines for writing code, documentation, and other materials related to the AAGI project.

Logos are made available in different formats to suit various needs, including print and digital media for AAGI projects only.

# AAGI Style Guide – Issues and Recommendations Report

## Introduction

This report outlines a series of issues identified in the current AAGI Style Guide, based on recent feedback and practical challenges encountered by team members. The aim is to highlight areas where the guide could be clarified, expanded, or updated to better support consistent and professional communication across all AAGI outputs. Each issue is accompanied by a recommendation to guide future revisions.

---

## 1. Logo Terminology

- **Issue**: The style guide refers to the logo as a "wheat sheaf."
- **Clarification**: The logo is more accurately described as a stylised **wheat ear**, not a sheaf.
- **Recommendation**: Update all references in the style guide to reflect the correct terminology to avoid confusion and ensure consistency.

---

## 2. Missing Document Guidelines

- **Issue**: The style guide lacks comprehensive documentation standards.
- **Details**: While there is some guidance for tables and PowerPoint title slides, there are no clear rules for:
  - Font colours and sizes
  - Heading hierarchies
  - General document formatting
- **Recommendation**: Develop a dedicated section outlining document formatting standards for consistency across all AAGI outputs.

---

## 3. Report Title Page Guidelines

- **Issue**: No style or content guidance exists for client reporting title pages.
- **Details**: AAGI delivers reporting for four key activities:
  - S&S
  - R&D
  - Upskilling & Awareness
  - Consultancies
- **Recommendation**: Introduce reference templates to ensure brand consistency for each report type outlining the font style (type, colour, size) content, location and heading hierarchy for, the AAGI title, reporting activity, client info, prep/author info, and date stamp. Do we really need to specify the leadership info or not?

---

## 4. 2026 SharePoint Footer Update

- **Issue**: The current footer uses University of Adelaide branding.
- **Future Requirement**: With the transition to Adelaide University, all branding will need to be updated.
- **Recommendation**: Begin planning for this transition, including:
  - Reviewing logo usage guidelines
  - Preparing updated templates
  - Coordinating with branding teams

---

## 5. Font Usage for AAGI Reporting
- **Issue**: Proxima Nova presents compatibility and usability issues.
- **Details**:
  - Difficult to integrate with LaTeX workflows (requires `xelatex`/`lualatex`)
  - Causes copy/paste issues in PDFs when fonts aren't embedded
- **Recommendation**:
  - Consider adopting a more universally compatible sans-serif font (e.g., Helvetica via LaTeX’s `helvet` package)
  - Ensure all exported PDFs embed fonts to preserve accessibility

---

## 6. Scope of the Style Guide

- **Issue**: Ambiguity around what constitutes an "AAGI output."
- **Details**: Misunderstandings exist about whether the style guide applies to external presentations.
- **Recommendation**: Clearly define the scope of the style guide, including:
  - Internal vs. external outputs
  - Educational vs. professional materials
  - Presentation, report, and publication standards
---

## 7. Colour Inconsistencies

- **Issue**: Colour values in the logo files do not match the hex codes in the style guide.
- **Details**: Discrepancies exist across file formats (PDF, SVG, PNG, etc.) and printed materials.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Audit all logo assets to ensure colour consistency
  - Standardise colour profiles across digital and print formats
  - Provide CMYK, RGB, and HEX values for all brand colours
