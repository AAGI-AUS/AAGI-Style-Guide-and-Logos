# AAGI Style Guide

<img src="assets/aagi-logo.svg" align="right" style="margin:10px" alt="Analytics for the Australian Grains Industry Logo, a stylised wheat ear that represents the Australian Grains Industry, while the two connector points represent data loading or data sensing points, often used when representing techy, data analytical organisations." />

This repository contains the style guide for Analytics for the Australian Grains Industry (AAGI) project.
It is a living document that will be updated as needed.

The new AAGI logo will be used in conjunction with the three strategic partners and GRDC.
The wheat ear represents the Australian Grains Industry, while the two connector points represent data loading or data sensing points, often used when representing techy, data analytical organisations.
The colours were chosen to look modern and techy.

The style guide is a collection of best practices and guidelines for writing code, documentation, and other materials related to the AAGI project.

Logos are made available in different formats to suit various needs, including print and digital media for AAGI projects only.

# AAGI Style Guide â€“ Issues and Recommendations Report

In June 2025, an evaluation of the AAGI Logo/Style Guide was made as a deliverable under Milestone 1 of the AAGI-AU-RD-WOP project, including suggested updates and modifications for further consideration by the AAGI leadership team. That document has been included in this repository as [Proposed Updates to the AAGI Style Guide - 2025-06-27.docx](https://github.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGI-Style-Guide-and-Logos/raw/refs/heads/main/Proposed%20Updates%20to%20the%20AAGI%20Style%20Guide%20-%202025-06-27.docx).
