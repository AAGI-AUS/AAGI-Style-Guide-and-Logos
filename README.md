This repository contains the style guide for Analytics for the Australian Grains Industry (AAGI) project.
It is a living document that will be updated as needed.

AAGI gives Australian growers an opportunity to be world leaders in analytics-driven decision making to drive efficiency and precision and support farm enterprise risk management.

The new AAGI logo will be used in conjunction with the three strategic partners and GRDC.
The wheat head represents the Australian Grains Industry, while the two connector points represent data loading or data sensing points, often used when representing techy, data analytical organisations.
The colours were chosen to look modern and techy.
